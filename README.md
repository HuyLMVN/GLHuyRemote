# GLTestMKFile
This is my repos for OpenGL code, as a result of combining whatever I've learned from OpenGL tutorials from Victor Gordan (YouTube) and Joey De Vries (learnopengl.com).

The GLFW library and header file go with this repos, while for Assimp, you might put your own lib file in lib folder and headers in include/extern folder, or just install it with a package manager.

The Makefile is for Windows, please modify it yourself if you use other OSs.

The code uses DSA from OpenGL 4.5, while 4.6 is the version specified in context creation. So if you what to make this work with pre-4.5 versions, considerable modification to the original code is needed.

Please remember that this is not any serious project, I just want to share some code with people. Also, don't anticipate any regular active development. There are no licences, so feel free to copy/fork/browse =)
